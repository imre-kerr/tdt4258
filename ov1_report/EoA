    The assignment was a good introduction to using the EFM32GG board. The 

compendium was easy to follow and made the task rather trivial. However the use 

of the reference manual was tedious, as it was not easy to look up the 

information you actually needed. As an example we tried to find out how you 

returned from the interrupt handler, looked at the quick reference and tried to 

find the instruction there, but was unable to do so. You may be able to find it 

in the 900 page reference manual, but trying to search through that manual for a 

task like this should not be neccecary. In all I would say that the task itself 

is a good introduction to the course, but even though you want us to look at the 

reference manual, there might be a better way to do this.
